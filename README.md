Split! is a free[^1] app for iOS and iPadOS, that allows a group of people to easily share expenses from a common receipt.
For example, roommates can do their shopping and pay for everything together.
Afterwards, one of them can scan the receipt, and attribute each expense to one person, several people or the whole group.
The app will calculate everyone's total, much faster than if you had to do it by hand.

## Technical Details
- This app works on Apple devices running iOS 15 / iPadOS 15 or higher
- Developped using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), which results in native and fluid components and animations
- The image recognition part is achieved through Apple's [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) Framework
- This project uses two [Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages) dependencies: [SlideOverCard](https://github.com/joogps/SlideOverCard), that provides beautiful tutorial cards, and [ConfettiSwiftUI](https://github.com/simibac/ConfettiSwiftUI), that provides confetti animations.
- Split! does not collect your data. You can find the privacy policy [here](PRIVACY.md).

## Highlights
Split! was selected as a **winner of Apple's Swift Student Challenge** at WWDC 2022. My project was further selected among the 12 best projects of this year, and presented in front of Tim Cook!

[^1]: Split! is **free**, **ad-free**, does **not collect your data**. It is developed independently by a student in his spare time. If you want to support the project, you can download the app and leave a tip!

[^2]: Except when using Tricount's services, which require an internet connection and acceptance of [Tricount's privacy policy](https://www.tricount.com/en/privacy-policy).

[^3]: Split! is not affiliated in any way with Tricount. It does not use the official [Tricount API](https://www.tricount.com/en/api), but a [workaround](https://github.com/hugoqnc/Split/blob/main/Split/Model/Tricount.swift).
